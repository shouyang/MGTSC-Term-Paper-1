## Motivation

- How do events translate into metrics?
- How do current events translate?
- What are some interesting questions?

## Tools

- Exploratory Data Analysis
	+ Define expectations
	+ Plot data
	+ Check expectations
- Outcomes:
	+ Refine expectations when needed
	+ Find insights where expectations aren't met
	+ Define analomalies
- John W. Tukey - Exploratory Data Analysis, 1977

## Context

- 21st Century: 2000 - Present

- Data Sources
	+ CANSIM
	+ Statistics Canada
	+ Provincial Goverments
	+ IBIS World

- Factors
	+ GDP
	+ Demographics
	+ Employment
	+ CPI
	+ Trade

## Key Findings

- GDP Centers 
	+ Ontario & Alberta
- Largest Industry Growth
	+ Construction
	+ Services 
- Population growth
	+ Not Nesscarily GDP growth
- Population growth
	+ 2/3 Births
	+ 1/3 Immigration
- Workforce Aging
	+ Changing proportions
	
## Key Dichotomies (Findings)

- Unemployment:
	+ Western vs Eastern Canada
- Bad Effects :
	+ 2015 Oil Slump vs 2008 Recession
- Trade       :
	+ Ontario vs Alberta

## Open Questions

- Decline of Goods production stopped by recession?
- Pharamaceuticals, lower investment = same growth rates?
- Gold and Silver, major export - accomplices?
- What triggered workforce aging?


## GDP Centers
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Save Old Parameters
opar = par()

par(mfrow=c(2,1))

# Transpose and Remove Aggregations From Data Table
Provinces <- read.csv("Data/GDP_Provinces.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)
Prov = data.frame(t(Provinces), stringsAsFactors = F)

names(Prov) = Prov[1,]

Prov = Prov[-1:-5,]

# Plot Dot charts

temp = Prov[order(Prov$`2015`),]

dotchart(
	temp$`2000`
	,labels = row.names(temp)
	,cex = 0.6
	,main = "Provincial GDP 2000"
	,sub  = "2007 Dollars"
	,xlim = c(0,650000)
)

temp = Prov[order(Prov$`2015`),]

dotchart(
	temp$`2015`

	,main = "Provincial GDP 2015"
	,sub  = "2007 Dollars"
	,xlim = c(0,650000)
	)

par(opar)

```

## GDP Centers

- 1995 - 2008 Steady GDP Growth
- Resource Boom 
	+ Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland & Labrador
- Manufacuring Declines
 	+ Employment in Ontario 15.8% (2000) versus 10.3% (2011)
	+ Automation
	+ "Global Value Chain"
	+ China

## GDP Centers

- Why Ontario?
	+ 20th Century
		- Canada-United States Automotive Pact
		- NAFTA
		- Correlation To US
	+ 21st Century
		- Public Spending
		- Immagration

## Employment Shifts

```{r,warning=FALSE}
Emp_CAN <- read.csv("Data/Employment_Canada.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

Emp_CAN = t(Emp_CAN)

temp = Emp_CAN[,c(1,16)]

temp = temp[-1,]

dimnames(temp)[[2]] = c("2000","2015")

temp = temp[order(temp[,1]),]


dotchart(temp[,1]
		 ,cex = 0.55
		 ,main = "2000s - Employment In Canada"
		 ,xlab = "1000's"
		 )
```

## Employment Shifts

```{r}
dotchart(temp[,2]
		 ,cex = 0.55
		 ,main = "2015s - Employment In Canada"
		 ,xlab = "1000's"
		 )

```

## Employment Shifts

- "For every job that has been lost in the goods sector since 2001, about 30 jobs have been created in service industries"

- Services as a diverse label
	+ Engineering
	+ Banking
	+ IT services
- Things In Common
	+ Demand in sophisticated professional services
	+ Remote Services, Stantec in Edmonton: 1/2 revenues outside Canadad
	+ EM Emerging middle class requires skills found elsewhere.

## Population Growth

- Growth Rate Differences
	+ Differences in Base Proportions However
- Pre and Post 2008 Growth in Alberta
- Constant Growth for Saskatchewan



## Population growth > 1/3 Immigration

![](Images/Population.PNG)

## On Immigration

- 9/11 Effects, Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
- In Spite, Canada is recognized as one of the most open immigration countries in the world.

## Workforce Aging

- Shift in growth eariler 2000's
- Long Life Spans?
- Baby Boomer Effect?
- Costlier Retirement?
- Consecquences
	+ An "Age Cliff"
	+ Productivity Effects?
	+ Expansionary Effects?

## Unemployment:

- Eastern Canada
	+ Higher Systemic Unemployment
	+ Large Population Centres alright though
	+ Decline in Manufacturing
- Western Canada
	+ Lowever systemic unemployment
	+ 2008 verus Oil Slump effects
	+ Boom in natural resources
